Algorithms for problem solving

This repository contains all the problems i solved during the third academic year subject CACM. In it we solve some of the problems proposed in the book Programming Challenges (http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf). It may happen that some of them have not been solved yet, but almost all are solved using the java programming language.

Use this as inspiration or help, but never as the unique solution for a given problem. Good luck!
