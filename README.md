Algorithms for problem solving

The repository you are seeing contains all the problems I solved for the fourth academic year subject CACM. The solved problems where extracted from the book Programming Challenges (http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf). It may happen that some of them have not been solved yet, but almost all are solved using the Java programming language.

Use this as inspiration or help, but never as the unique solution for a given problem. Good luck!
